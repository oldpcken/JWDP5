This is the Project 5 eCommerce site for the Junior Web Developer path.

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine in the backend folder.

### Installation ###

From within the backend project folder, run `npm install`. You can then run the server with `node server`. The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
